4. 5. 6. PHP
	4.1.  Introduction to PHP
		  * The term PHP is an acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.
		  
	4.2.  Basic rule of PHP
		  * PHP owns the top-level namespace but tries to find decent descriptive names and avoid any obvious clashes.

		  * Function names use underscores between words, while class names use both the camelCase and PascalCase rules.

          * PHP will prefix any global symbols of an extension with the name of the extension. (In the past, there have been numerous exceptions to this rule.)
          * Iterators and Exceptions are however simply postfixed with "Iterator" and "Exception."
          * PHP reserves all symbols starting with __ as magical. It is recommended that you do not create symbols starting with __ in PHP unless you want to use documented magical functionality.
