8.1.  Introduction to XML
		  What is XML?
			The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple text-based format for representing structured information: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, and much more. It was derived from an older standard format called SGML (ISO 8879), in order to be more suitable for Web use.

		  What is XML Used For?
			XML is one of the most widely-used formats for sharing structured information today: between programs, between people, between computers and people, both locally and across networks.
	8.2.  Revision of HTML and Client Server Architecture
			Check Client-Server image
	8.3.  Reason for XML
			ML can be used to describe and identify information accurately and unambiguously, in a way that computers can be programmed to ‘understand’ your information (well, at least manipulate as if they could understand it).

			XML allows sets of documents which are all the same type to be created and handled consistently and without structural errors, because it provides a standardised way of describing, controlling, or allowing/disallowing particular types of document structure. 
			XML provides a robust and durable format for information storage and transmission. Robust because it is based on a proven standard, and can thus be tested and verified; durable (persistent) because it uses plain-text file formats which will outlast proprietary binary ones.
			If everyone uses the same syntax it makes writing these systems much faster and more reliable.
			XML information can be manipulated programmatically (under machine control), so XML documents can be pieced together from disparate sources, or taken apart and re-used in different ways. They can be converted into any other format with no loss of information.
	8.4.  XML and the browser

			<heading>Reminder</heading>
			<body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
			</note>
	8.5.  XML Validation
			An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed".

			The syntax rules were described in the previous chapters:

			XML documents must have a root element
			XML elements must have a closing tag
			XML tags are case sensitive
			XML elements must be properly nested
			XML attribute values must be quoted
	8.6.  XML as the mode of data transfer
			Typical use cases could be passing data in XML format during some REST API call’s though JSON is quickly catching on this front. SOAP used XML
			SOAP is an acronym for Simple Object Access Protocol. It is an XML-based messaging protocol for exchanging information among computers. SOAP is an application of the XML specification.
			AJAX call.
	8.7.  XML Parser
			All major browsers have a built-in XML parser to access and manipulate XML.
			XML Parser
			The XML DOM (Document Object Model) defines the properties and methods for accessing and editing XML.
			However, before an XML document can be accessed, it must be loaded into an XML DOM object.
			All modern browsers have a built-in XML parser that can convert text into an XML DOM object.

			Types of XML Parsers
			These are the two main types of XML Parsers:

			DOM
			SAX
			DOM (Document Object Model)
			A DOM document is an object which contains all the information of an XML document. It is composed like a tree structure. The DOM Parser implements a DOM API. This API is very simple to use.

			Features of DOM Parser
			A DOM Parser creates an internal structure in memory which is a DOM document object and the client applications get information of the original XML document by invoking methods on this document object.

			DOM Parser has a tree based structure.

			Advantages
			1) It supports both read and write operations and the API is very simple to use.

			2) It is preferred when random access to widely separated parts of a document is required.

			Disadvantages
			1) It is memory inefficient. (consumes more memory because the whole XML document needs to loaded into memory).

			2) It is comparatively slower than other parsers.

			SAX (Simple API for XML)
			A SAX Parser implements SAX API. This API is an event based API and less intuitive.

			Features of SAX Parser
			It does not create any internal structure.

			Clients does not know what methods to call, they just overrides the methods of the API and place his own code inside method.

			It is an event based parser, it works like an event handler in Java.

			Advantages
			1) It is simple and memory efficient.

			2) It is very fast and works for huge documents.

			Disadvantages
			1) It is event-based so its API is less intuitive.

			2) Clients never know the full information because the data is broken into pieces.

	8.10. Parts of the XML Document

	8.11. XML Schema
			What is an XML Schema?
			An XML Schema describes the structure of an XML document.
			The XML Schema language is also referred to as XML Schema Definition (XSD).
			
			The purpose of an XML Schema is to define the legal building blocks of an XML document:
			the elements and attributes that can appear in a document
			the number of (and order of) child elements
			data types for elements and attributes
			default and fixed values for elements and attributes

			Why Learn XML Schema?
			In the XML world, hundreds of standardized XML formats are in daily use.
			Many of these XML standards are defined by XML Schemas.
			XML Schema is an XML-based (and more powerful) alternative to DTD.

			XML Schemas Support Data Types
			One of the greatest strength of XML Schemas is the support for data types.

			It is easier to describe allowable document content
			It is easier to validate the correctness of data
			It is easier to define data facets (restrictions on data)
			It is easier to define data patterns (data formats)
			It is easier to convert data between different data types
			
			XML Schemas use XML Syntax
			Another great strength about XML Schemas is that they are written in XML.
			You don't have to learn a new language
			You can use your XML editor to edit your Schema files
			You can use your XML parser to parse your Schema files
			You can manipulate your Schema with the XML DOM
			You can transform your Schema with XSLT
			XML Schemas are extensible, because they are written in XML.

			With an extensible Schema definition you can:
			Reuse your Schema in other Schemas
			Create your own data types derived from the standard types
			Reference multiple schemas in the same document

			XML Schemas Secure Data Communication
			When sending data from a sender to a receiver, it is essential that both parts have the same "expectations" about the content.
			With XML Schemas, the sender can describe the data in a way that the receiver will understand.
			A date like: "03-11-2004" will, in some countries, be interpreted as 3.November and in other countries as 11.March.
			However, an XML element with a data type like this:
			<date type="date">2004-03-11</date>
			ensures a mutual understanding of the content, because the XML data type "date" requires the format "YYYY-MM-DD".

			Well-Formed is Not Enough
			A well-formed XML document is a document that conforms to the XML syntax rules, like:

			it must begin with the XML declaration
			it must have one unique root element
			start-tags must have matching end-tags
			elements are case sensitive
			all elements must be closed
			all elements must be properly nested
			all attribute values must be quoted
			entities must be used for special characters
			Even if documents are well-formed they can still contain errors, and those errors can have serious consequences.

			Think of the following situation: you order 5 gross of laser printers, instead of 5 laser printers. With XML Schemas, most of these errors can be caught by your validating software.
	8.12. Namespaces
			<root>

			<h:table xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">
			  <h:tr>
			    <h:td>Apples</h:td>
			    <h:td>Bananas</h:td>
			  </h:tr>
			</h:table>

			<f:table xmlns:f="https://www.w3schools.com/furniture">
			  <f:name>African Coffee Table</f:name>
			  <f:width>80</f:width>
			  <f:length>120</f:length>
			</f:table>

			</root>
	8.13. The Root Element
			XML documents must contain one root element that is the parent of all other elements:

	8.14. Tags and Elements (DTD)
	An element can contain:
			text
			attributes
			other elements
			or a mix of the above

	8.16. CDATA and PCDATA
			PCDATA - Parsed Character Data
			XML parsers normally parse all the text in an XML document.

			CDATA - (Unparsed) Character Data
			The term CDATA is used about text data that should not be parsed by the XML parser.
			Characters like "<" and "&" are illegal in XML elements.
	8.17. XML Tree Structure
	8.18. XML style language
			XSL - More Than a Style Sheet Language
			XSL consists of four parts:

			XSLT - a language for transforming XML documents
			XPath - a language for navigating in XML documents
			XSL-FO - a language for formatting XML documents (discontinued in 2013)
			XQuery - a language for querying XML documents


	9.1.  XML DTD
			What is DTD
				DTD stands for Document Type Definition. It defines the legal building blocks of an XML document. It is used to define document structure with a list of legal elements and attributes.

			Purpose of DTD
				Its main purpose is to define the structure of an XML document. It contains a list of legal elements and define the structure with the help of them.
	9.2.  Creating Document Type Declarations
			Let's create the DTD file.
			<!ELEMENT employee (firstname,lastname,email)>  
			<!ELEMENT firstname (#PCDATA)>  
			<!ELEMENT lastname (#PCDATA)>  
			<!ELEMENT email (#PCDATA)>  

	9.3.  Creating Document Type Definition
			Let's create the DTD file. employee.dtd (external dta eg.)
			<!ELEMENT employee (firstname,lastname,email)>  
			<!ELEMENT firstname (#PCDATA)>  
			<!ELEMENT lastname (#PCDATA)>  
			<!ELEMENT email (#PCDATA)>  


			<?xml version="1.0"?>  
			<?xml-stylesheet type="text/css" href="cssemployee.css"?>  
			<!DOCTYPE employee SYSTEM "employee.dtd">  
			<employee>  
			  <firstname>vimal</firstname>  
			  <lastname>jaiswal</lastname>  
			  <email>vimal@javatpoint.com</email>  
			</employee> 
	9.4.  Internal and External DTD`s

			<?xml version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8" standalone = "yes" ?>

			<!DOCTYPE address [
			   <!ELEMENT address (name,company,phone)>
			   <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
			   <!ELEMENT company (#PCDATA)>
			   <!ELEMENT phone (#PCDATA)>
			]>

			<address>
			   <name>Tanmay Patil</name>
			   <company>TutorialsPoint</company>
			   <phone>(011) 123-4567</phone>
			</address>
	9.5.  Associationg DTD`s with XML documents. (The XML Declaration and DOCTYPE declaration)
	9.6.  Validating documents against a DTD
			How to associate an XML Document with a DTD
			To validate an XML Document against a DTD (Document Type Declaration), you need to associate your XML Document with the DTD: Click Schema > Associate XML Document with DTD, Relax NG Schema, or XML Schema..., and select a DTD. You can also do this yourself, for example:
			<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
			<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
			<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
			</html>
			This tells XMLBlueprint to validate the XML Document against DTD "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd". The 'PUBLIC' part is optional, this is also possible:
			<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
			<!DOCTYPE html SYSTEM "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
			<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
			</html>
	9.7.  Internal and External General Entities
			INTERNAL (PARSED)
			EXTERNAL (PARSED)
			EXTERNAL (UNPARSED)

			INTERNAL (PARSED) GENERAL ENTITY Declaration:
			Internal parsed entities generally reference text. The correct definition is that they refer to data that an XML processor has to parse.
			<!ENTITY name "entity_value">
			where:
			entity value: any character that is not an '&', '%' or ' " ', a parameter entity reference ('%Name;'), an entity reference ('&Name;') or a Unicodeglossary character reference.

			<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes" ?>
			<!DOCTYPE author [
			  <!ELEMENT author (#PCDATA)>
			  <!ENTITY js "Jo Smith">
			]>
			<author>&js;</author>

			EXTERNAL (PARSED) GENERAL ENTITY Declaration:
			External parsed entities generally reference text. The correct definition is that they refer to data that an XML processor has to parse. External entities are useful for creating a common reference that can be shared between multiple documents. Any changes that are made to external entities are automatically updated in the documents they are referenced. There are two types of external entities: private, and public. Private external entities are identified by the keyword SYSTEM, and are intended for use by a single author or group of authors. Public external entities are identified by the keyword PUBLIC and are intended for broad use.
			<!ENTITY name SYSTEM "URI">
			<!ENTITY name PUBLIC "public_ID" "URI">
			where:
			URI: In practice, this is a URL where the external parsed entity can be found.
			public_ID: This may be used by an XML processor to generate an alternate URI where the external parsed entity can be found. If it cannot be found at this URI, the XML processor must use the normal URI.

			<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no" ?>
			<!DOCTYPE copyright [
			  <!ELEMENT copyright (#PCDATA)>
			  <!ENTITY c SYSTEM "http://www.xmlwriter.net/copyright.xml">
			]>
			<copyright>&c;</copyright>

			EXTERNAL (UNPARSED) GENERAL ENTITY Declaration:

			External unparsed entities generally reference non-XML data. The 100% correct definition is that they refer to data that an XML processor does not have to parse.
			<!ENTITY name SYSTEM "URI" NDATA name>
			<!ENTITY name PUBLIC "public_ID" "URI" NDATA name>
			<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no" ?>
			<!DOCTYPE img [
			  <!ELEMENT img EMPTY>
			  <!ATTLIST img src ENTITY #REQUIRED> 
			  <!ENTITY logo SYSTEM "http://www.xmlwriter.net/logo.gif" NDATA gif>
			  <!NOTATION gif PUBLIC "gif viewer">
			]>
			<img src="logo"/>
	9.8.  Element Type(ELEMENT) Declarations
			ELEMENT Type Declaration
			Element type declarations set the rules for the type and number of elements that may appear in an XML document, what elements may appear inside each other, and what order they must appear in.

			<!ELEMENT name allowable_contents>
			Example:
			<!ELEMENT foo (#PCDATA)>
			<!ELEMENT img EMPTY>
			Rules:
			All element typesglossary used in an XML document must be declared in the Document Type Definition (DTD) using an Element Type Declarationvalidity constraint.
			An element type cannot be declared more than oncevalidity constraint.
			The name in the element type's end tagglossary must match the name in the element type's start tagglossarywell-formedness constraint. Element names are case sensitive.
			The keyword ELEMENT must be in upper casewell-formedness constraint.

	9.9.  Attribute (ATTLIST) Declarations
			Declaring Attributes
			An attribute declaration has the following syntax:

			<!ATTLIST element-name attribute-name attribute-type attribute-value>

			DTD example:

			<!ATTLIST payment type CDATA "check">

			XML example:

			<payment type="check" />
			The attribute-type can be one of the following:

			Type	Description
			CDATA	The value is character data
			(en1|en2|..)	The value must be one from an enumerated list
			ID	The value is a unique id
			IDREF	The value is the id of another element
			IDREFS	The value is a list of other ids
			NMTOKEN	The value is a valid XML name
			NMTOKENS	The value is a list of valid XML names
			ENTITY	The value is an entity
			ENTITIES	The value is a list of entities
			NOTATION	The value is a name of a notation
			xml:	The value is a predefined xml value
			The attribute-value can be one of the following:

			Value	Explanation
			value	The default value of the attribute
			#REQUIRED	The attribute is required
			#IMPLIED	The attribute is optional
			#FIXED value	The attribute value is fixed
	9.10. Using INCLUDE AND IGNORE
